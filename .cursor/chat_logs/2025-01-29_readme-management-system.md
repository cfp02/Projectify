# README Management System Implementation
Date: 2024-03-19
Topic: Implementation of README management system with version control

## Context
Implementation of a README-centric project management system with version control, structured templates, and API endpoints for managing README content.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. README Template Structure
- Implemented detailed template with project management instructions
- Added special markers (ðŸš¨) for Cursor-critical sections
- Created structured format for progress tracking
- Included comprehensive section templates

### 2. API Endpoints
- Created endpoints for:
  - Fetching README content
  - Creating/updating README versions
  - Restoring previous versions
- Implemented proper error handling and response formats
- Fixed TypeScript issues with README version model

### 3. Database Schema
- Added README and ReadmeVersion models
- Implemented version tracking system
- Created activity logging for version-related actions

### 4. Frontend Integration
- Added ReadmeEditor component to project detail page
- Implemented version history display
- Added restore version functionality

## Technical Decisions
1. Removed userId field from ReadmeVersion model for simplified version tracking
2. Standardized API responses to return JSON objects
3. Implemented proper session validation using email
4. Added structured error handling for unauthorized access and version not found scenarios

## Next Steps
1. Implement project section management
2. Add resource upload capabilities
3. Enhance version comparison features
4. Add GitHub README sync functionality

## Code Changes Summary
- Modified `src/app/api/projects/[id]/readme/route.ts` for API endpoints
- Updated database schema for README management
- Added ReadmeEditor component to project detail page
- Created structured README template

## Notes for Future Context
- The README template structure is critical for Cursor compatibility
- Version restoration requires careful handling of database transactions
- Error handling should maintain consistent JSON response format
- Session validation uses email instead of userId for authentication
