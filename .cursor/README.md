# .cursor Directory

This directory contains Cursor-specific files and configurations that enhance the development experience with the Cursor IDE.

## Directory Structure

- `chat_logs/`: Contains saved chat conversations with the Cursor AI assistant
  - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM_topic.md`
  - Each file includes:
    - Timestamp
    - Conversation context
    - Key decisions and changes made
    - Code modifications
    - Next steps or follow-up items

## Usage

### Chat Logs
Chat logs are valuable for:
1. Maintaining context across development sessions
2. Documenting decision-making processes
3. Training future AI interactions
4. Creating summaries of development progress

To use chat logs as context:
1. Store each significant conversation in `chat_logs/`
2. Use descriptive filenames that indicate the topic
3. Include relevant metadata at the start of each file
4. Optionally use an LLM to summarize longer conversations

### Best Practices
1. Save important conversations immediately after completion
2. Include clear section headers for different parts of the conversation
3. Tag key decisions or important code changes
4. Keep files focused on specific topics or features
5. Regular cleanup of outdated or redundant logs

## Integration with Cursor
These logs can be used as additional context when working with Cursor by:
1. Referencing specific chat logs for related tasks
2. Using summaries as project context
3. Maintaining development history alongside code changes
