## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine
- Git for version control

### Development Setup
1. Clone this repository
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd projectify
   ```

2. Development Options:

   A. Using VS Code Dev Containers (Recommended):
   - Install the "Remote - Containers" extension in VS Code
   - Open the project in VS Code
   - Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted
   - The container will build and set up the development environment automatically
   - All necessary extensions will be installed automatically

   B. Using Docker Compose directly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

3. The application will be available at:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Database: localhost:5432

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://projectify:projectify_dev@db:5432/projectify_dev"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```
