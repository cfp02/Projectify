# Projectify

## Project Overview
Projectify is a comprehensive project management and portfolio platform designed to help developers track, document, and showcase their projects. It features voice input capabilities, AI-powered project analysis, and seamless project state tracking to help developers easily resume work on projects after breaks. The platform centers around project READMEs as living documents, whether from GitHub repositories or stored locally, while maintaining flexibility in format and structure.

  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",
  "typescript": "^5.4.2"
}
```

#### Key Features Enabled by Dependencies

- **@auth/prisma-adapter & next-auth**: Authentication system with GitHub and Google sign-in
- **@prisma/client & prisma**: Database ORM for PostgreSQL
- **@tailwindcss packages**: Styling and form handling
- **react-markdown**: README rendering and editing
- **Testing packages**: Complete testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library

### Quick Start (After Initial Setup)
If you've already set up the project and are returning to development:

1. Start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

2. Verify services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```

3. Access the application:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Try signing in with GitHub or Google

4. If you need to rebuild (after dependency changes or code updates):
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   docker compose up --build
   ```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Development Workflow
**ALWAYS USE DOCKER FOR DEVELOPMENT**
1. The application is containerized and should ALWAYS be run using Docker Compose
2. Do NOT run `npm run dev` locally, as this may conflict with the Docker container
3. After making code changes:
   ```bash
   # Stop all containers
   docker compose down

   # Rebuild and start containers with new changes
   docker compose up --build
   ```
4. Common issues and solutions:
   - If you see "Port 3000 is in use": Make sure to stop any local development servers
   - If changes aren't appearing: Ensure you've rebuilt the containers with `docker compose up --build`
   - If database issues occur: Check if the database container is running with `docker compose ps`

## Technical Documentation
<details>
<summary>Testing Setup</summary>

### Test Dependencies
```json
{
  "@testing-library/jest-dom": "^6.4.2",
  "@testing-library/react": "^14.2.1",
  "@types/jest": "^29.5.12",
  "jest": "^29.7.0",
  "jest-environment-jsdom": "^29.7.0"
}
```

### Configuration Files

- `jest.setup.js`: Sets up testing environment

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Writing Tests
Tests are co-located with their components using the `.test.tsx` extension. Example:
```typescript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import { YourComponent } from './YourComponent'

describe('YourComponent', () => {
  it('renders expected content', () => {

  })
})
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>CI/CD Pipeline</summary>

### Continuous Integration (CI)
On every push and pull request to `main`:
1. Installs dependencies
2. Runs TypeScript type checking
3. Runs ESLint
4. Executes Jest tests
5. Builds the application

### Continuous Deployment (CD)
On version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`):
1. Runs all CI checks
2. Builds Docker container
3. Deploys to production (if all checks pass)

### Release Process
1. Create a new version tag:
```bash
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```

2. The CD pipeline will automatically:
   - Build and test the application
   - Deploy to production if all checks pass

Version format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- MAJOR: Breaking changes
- MINOR: New features
- PATCH: Bug fixes
